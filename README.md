## Build 

To compile PhotoSwipe by yourself, make sure that you have [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/), [Grunt.js](https://github.com/cowboy/grunt), [Ruby](http://www.ruby-lang.org/) and [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/) installed, then:

1) Clone the repository

	git clone https://github.com/dimsemenov/PhotoSwipe.git

2) Go inside the PhotoSwipe folder that you fetched and install Node dependencies

	cd PhotoSwipe && npm install

3) Run `grunt` to generate the JS and CSS files in the `dist` folder and the site in the `_site/` folder

	grunt

Optionally:

- Run `grunt watch` to automatically rebuild files (JS, CSS, demo website and documentation) when you change files in `src/` or in `website/`.
- Run `grunt nosite` to build just JS and CSS files (output is folder `dist/`).
- Run `grunt pswpbuild` to build just JS files. Param `--pswp-exclude` allows to exclude modules, for example `grunt pswpbuild --pswp-exclude=history` will exclude history module.
