<h1>Using Apache Ant</h1>
<h2><a name="buildfile">Writing a Simple Buildfile</a></h2>
<p>Apache Ant's buildfiles are written in XML. Each buildfile contains one project
and at least one (default) target. Targets contain task elements.
Each task element of the buildfile can have an <code>id</code> attribute and
can later be referred to by the value supplied to this. The value has
to be unique. (For additional information, see the
<a href="#tasks"> Tasks</a> section below.)</p>
<h3><a name="projects">Projects</a></h3>
<p>A <i>project</i> has three attributes:</p>
<table border="1" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0">
  <tr>
    <td valign="top"><b>Attribute</b></td>
    <td valign="top"><b>Description</b></td>
    <td align="center" valign="top"><b>Required</b></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td valign="top">name</td>
    <td valign="top">the name of the project.</td>
    <td align="center" valign="top">No</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td valign="top">default</td>
    <td valign="top">the default target to use when no target is supplied.</td>
    <td align="center" valign="top">No; however, <b>since Ant 1.6.0</b>,
        every project includes an implicit target that contains any and
        all top-level tasks and/or types. This target will always be
        executed as part of the project's initialization, even when Ant is
        run with the <a href="running.html#options">-projecthelp</a> option.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td valign="top">basedir</td>
    <td valign="top">the base directory from which all path calculations are
      done. This attribute might be overridden by setting
      the &quot;basedir&quot;
      property beforehand. When this is done, it must be omitted in the
      project tag. If neither the attribute nor the property have
      been set, the parent directory of the buildfile will be used.<br/>
      A relative path is resolved relative to the directory containing
      the build file.
    </td>
    <td align="center" valign="top">No</td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>Optionally, a description for the project can be provided as a
top-level <code>&lt;description&gt;</code> element (see the <a
href="Types/description.html">description</a> type).</p>

<p>Each project defines one or more <i>targets</i>.
A target is a set of <i>tasks</i> you want
to be executed. When starting Ant, you can select which target(s) you
want to have executed. When no target is given,
the project's default is used.</p>

<h3><a name="targets">Targets</a></h3>
<p>A target can depend on other targets. You might have a target for compiling,
for example, and a target for creating a distributable. You can only build a
distributable when you have compiled first, so the distribute target
<i>depends on</i> the compile target. Ant resolves these dependencies.</p>
<p>It should be noted, however, that Ant's <code>depends</code> attribute
only specifies the <i>order</i> in which targets should be executed - it
does not affect whether the target that specifies the dependency(s) gets
executed if the dependent target(s) did not (need to) run.
</p>

<p>More information can be found in the
  dedicated <a href="targets.html">manual page</a>.</p>

<h3><a name="tasks">Tasks</a></h3>
<p>A task is a piece of code that can be executed.</p>
<p>A task can have multiple attributes (or arguments, if you prefer). The value
of an attribute might contain references to a property. These references will be
resolved before the task is executed.</p>
<p>Tasks have a common structure:</p>
<blockquote>
  <pre>&lt;<i>name</i> <i>attribute1</i>=&quot;<i>value1</i>&quot; <i>attribute2</i>=&quot;<i>value2</i>&quot; ... /&gt;</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>where <i>name</i> is the name of the task,
<i>attributeN</i> is the attribute name, and
<i>valueN</i> is the value for this attribute.</p>
<p>There is a set of <a href="tasklist.html" target="navFrame">built-in tasks</a>, but it is also very
easy to <a href="develop.html#writingowntask">write your own</a>.</p>
<p>All tasks share a task name attribute. The value of
this attribute will be used in the logging messages generated by
Ant.</p>
Tasks can be assigned an <code>id</code> attribute:
<blockquote>
<pre>&lt;<i>taskname</i> id="<i>taskID</i>" ... /&gt;</pre>
</blockquote>
where <i>taskname</i> is the name of the task, and <i>taskID</i> is
a unique identifier for this task.
You can refer to the
corresponding task object in scripts or other tasks via this name.
For example, in scripts you could do:
<blockquote>
<pre>
&lt;script ... &gt;
  task1.setFoo("bar");
&lt;/script&gt;
</pre>
</blockquote>
to set the <code>foo</code> attribute of this particular task instance.
In another task (written in Java), you can access the instance via
<code>project.getReference("task1")</code>.
<p>
Note<sup>1</sup>: If &quot;task1&quot; has not been run yet, then
it has not been configured (ie., no attributes have been set), and if it is
going to be configured later, anything you've done to the instance may
be overwritten.
</p>
<p>
Note<sup>2</sup>: Future versions of Ant will most likely <i>not</i>
be backward-compatible with this behaviour, since there will likely be no
task instances at all, only proxies.
</p>

<h3><a name="properties">Properties</a></h3>

<p>Properties are an important way to customize a build process or
  to just provide shortcuts for strings that are used repeatedly
  inside a build file.</p>

<p>In its most simple form properties are defined in the build file
  (for example by the <a href="Tasks/property.html">property</a>
  task) or might be set outside Ant.  A property has a name and a
  value; the name is case-sensitive. Properties may be used in the
  value of task attributes or in the nested text of tasks that support
  them.  This is done by placing the property name between
  &quot;<code>${</code>&quot; and &quot;<code>}</code>&quot; in the
  attribute value. For example, if there is a &quot;builddir&quot;
  property with the value &quot;build&quot;, then this could be used
  in an attribute like this: <code>${builddir}/classes</code>.  This
  is resolved at run-time as <code>build/classes</code>.</p>

<p>With Ant 1.8.0 property expansion has become much more powerful
  than simple key value pairs, more details can be
  found <a href="properties.html">in the concepts section</a> of this
  manual.</p>

<h3><a name="example">Example Buildfile</a></h3>
<pre>
&lt;project name=&quot;MyProject&quot; default=&quot;dist&quot; basedir=&quot;.&quot;&gt;
    &lt;description&gt;
        simple example build file
    &lt;/description&gt;
  &lt;!-- set global properties for this build --&gt;
  &lt;property name=&quot;src&quot; location=&quot;src&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;property name=&quot;build&quot; location=&quot;build&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;property name=&quot;dist&quot;  location=&quot;dist&quot;/&gt;

  &lt;target name=&quot;init&quot;&gt;
    &lt;!-- Create the time stamp --&gt;
    &lt;tstamp/&gt;
    &lt;!-- Create the build directory structure used by compile --&gt;
    &lt;mkdir dir=&quot;${build}&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;/target&gt;

  &lt;target name=&quot;compile&quot; depends=&quot;init&quot;
        description=&quot;compile the source &quot; &gt;
    &lt;!-- Compile the java code from ${src} into ${build} --&gt;
    &lt;javac srcdir=&quot;${src}&quot; destdir=&quot;${build}&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;/target&gt;

  &lt;target name=&quot;dist&quot; depends=&quot;compile&quot;
        description=&quot;generate the distribution&quot; &gt;
    &lt;!-- Create the distribution directory --&gt;
    &lt;mkdir dir=&quot;${dist}/lib&quot;/&gt;

    &lt;!-- Put everything in ${build} into the MyProject-${DSTAMP}.jar file --&gt;
    &lt;jar jarfile=&quot;${dist}/lib/MyProject-${DSTAMP}.jar&quot; basedir=&quot;${build}&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;/target&gt;

  &lt;target name=&quot;clean&quot;
        description=&quot;clean up&quot; &gt;
    &lt;!-- Delete the ${build} and ${dist} directory trees --&gt;
    &lt;delete dir=&quot;${build}&quot;/&gt;
    &lt;delete dir=&quot;${dist}&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;/target&gt;
&lt;/project&gt;
</pre>

<p>Notice that we are declaring properties outside any target.  As of
Ant 1.6 all tasks can be declared outside targets (earlier version
only allowed <tt>&lt;property&gt;</tt>,<tt>&lt;typedef&gt;</tt> and
<tt>&lt;taskdef&gt;</tt>).  When you do this they are evaluated before
any targets are executed.  Some tasks will generate build failures if
they are used outside of targets as they may cause infinite loops
otherwise (<code>&lt;antcall&gt;</code> for example).</p>

<p>
We have given some targets descriptions; this causes the <tt>projecthelp</tt>
invocation option to list them as public targets with the descriptions; the
other target is internal and not listed.
<p>
Finally, for this target to work the source in the <tt>src</tt> subdirectory
should be stored in a directory tree which matches the package names. Check the
<tt>&lt;javac&gt;</tt> task for details.

<h3><a name="filters">Token Filters</a></h3>
<p>A project can have a set of tokens that might be automatically expanded if
found when a file is copied, when the filtering-copy behavior is selected in the
tasks that support this. These might be set in the buildfile
by the <a href="Tasks/filter.html">filter</a> task.</p>
<p>Since this can potentially be a very harmful behavior,
the tokens in the files <b>must</b>
be of the form <code>@</code><i>token</i><code>@</code>, where
<i>token</i> is the token name that is set
in the <code>&lt;filter&gt;</code> task. This token syntax matches the syntax of other build systems
that perform such filtering and remains sufficiently orthogonal to most
programming and scripting languages, as well as with documentation systems.</p>
<p>Note: If a token with the format <code>@</code><i>token</i><code>@</code>
is found in a file, but no
filter is associated with that token, no changes take place;
therefore, no escaping
method is available - but as long as you choose appropriate names for your
tokens, this should not cause problems.</p>
<p><b>Warning:</b> If you copy binary files with filtering turned on, you can corrupt the
files. This feature should be used with text files <em>only</em>.</p>

<h3><a name="path">Path-like Structures</a></h3>
<p>You can specify <code>PATH</code>- and <code>CLASSPATH</code>-type
references using both
&quot;<code>:</code>&quot; and &quot;<code>;</code>&quot; as separator
characters. Ant will
convert the separator to the correct character of the current operating
system.</p>
<p>Wherever path-like values need to be specified, a nested element can
be used. This takes the general form of:</p>
<pre>
    &lt;classpath&gt;
      &lt;pathelement path=&quot;${classpath}&quot;/&gt;
      &lt;pathelement location=&quot;lib/helper.jar&quot;/&gt;
    &lt;/classpath&gt;
</pre>
<p>The <code>location</code> attribute specifies a single file or
directory relative to the project's base directory (or an absolute
filename), while the <code>path</code> attribute accepts colon-
or semicolon-separated lists of locations. The <code>path</code>
attribute is intended to be used with predefined paths - in any other
case, multiple elements with <code>location</code> attributes should be
preferred.</p>
<p><em>Since Ant 1.8.2</em> the location attribute can also contain a
  wildcard in its last path component (i.e. it can end in a
  &quot;*&quot;) in order to support wildcard CLASSPATHs introduced
  with Java6.  Ant will not expand or evaluate the wildcards and the
  resulting path may not work as anything else but a CLASSPATH - or
  even as a CLASSPATH for a Java VM prior to Java6.</p>
<p>As a shortcut, the <code>&lt;classpath&gt;</code> tag
supports <code>path</code> and
<code>location</code> attributes of its own, so:</p>
<pre>
    &lt;classpath&gt;
      &lt;pathelement path=&quot;${classpath}&quot;/&gt;
    &lt;/classpath&gt;
</pre>
<p>can be abbreviated to:</p>
<pre>
    &lt;classpath path=&quot;${classpath}&quot;/&gt;
</pre>
<p>In addition, one or more
<a href="Types/resources.html#collection">Resource Collection</a>s
can be specified as nested elements (these must consist of
<a href="Types/resources.html#file">file</a>-type resources only).
Additionally, it should be noted that although resource collections are
processed in the order encountered, certain resource collection types
such as <a href="Types/fileset.html">fileset</a>,
<a href="Types/dirset.html">dirset</a> and
<a href="Types/resources.html#files">files</a>
are undefined in terms of order.</p>
<pre>
    &lt;classpath&gt;
      &lt;pathelement path=&quot;${classpath}&quot;/&gt;
      &lt;fileset dir=&quot;lib&quot;&gt;
        &lt;include name=&quot;**/*.jar&quot;/&gt;
      &lt;/fileset&gt;
      &lt;pathelement location=&quot;classes&quot;/&gt;
      &lt;dirset dir=&quot;${build.dir}&quot;&gt;
        &lt;include name=&quot;apps/**/classes&quot;/&gt;
        &lt;exclude name=&quot;apps/**/*Test*&quot;/&gt;
      &lt;/dirset&gt;
      &lt;filelist refid=&quot;third-party_jars&quot;/&gt;
    &lt;/classpath&gt;
</pre>
<p>This builds a path that holds the value of <code>${classpath}</code>,
followed by all jar files in the <code>lib</code> directory,
the <code>classes</code> directory, all directories named
<code>classes</code> under the <code>apps</code> subdirectory of
<code>${build.dir}</code>, except those
that have the text <code>Test</code> in their name, and
the files specified in the referenced FileList.</p>
<p>If you want to use the same path-like structure for several tasks,
you can define them with a <code>&lt;path&gt;</code> element at the
same level as <i>target</i>s, and reference them via their
<i>id</i> attribute--see <a href="#references">References</a> for an
example.</p>

<p>By default a path like structure will re-evaluate all nested
  resource collections whenever it is used, which may lead to
  unnecessary re-scanning of the filesystem.  Since Ant 1.8.0 path has
  an optional <i>cache</i> attribute, if it is set to true, the path
  instance will only scan its nested resource collections once and
  assume it doesn't change during the build anymore (the default
  for <i>cache</i> still is <i>false</i>).  Even if you are using the
  path only in a single task it may improve overall performance to set
  <i>cache</i> to <i>true</i> if you are using complex nested
  constructs.</p>

<p>A path-like structure can include a reference to another path-like
structure (a path being itself a resource collection)
via nested <code>&lt;path&gt;</code> elements:</p>
<pre>
    &lt;path id=&quot;base.path&quot;&gt;
      &lt;pathelement path=&quot;${classpath}&quot;/&gt;
      &lt;fileset dir=&quot;lib&quot;&gt;
        &lt;include name=&quot;**/*.jar&quot;/&gt;
      &lt;/fileset&gt;
      &lt;pathelement location=&quot;classes&quot;/&gt;
    &lt;/path&gt;

    &lt;path id=&quot;tests.path&quot; cache=&quot;true&quot;&gt;
      &lt;path refid=&quot;base.path&quot;/&gt;
      &lt;pathelement location=&quot;testclasses&quot;/&gt;
    &lt;/path&gt;
</pre>
 The shortcuts previously mentioned for <code>&lt;classpath&gt;</code> are also valid for <code>&lt;path&gt;</code>.For example:
<pre>
    &lt;path id=&quot;base.path&quot;&gt;
      &lt;pathelement path=&quot;${classpath}&quot;/&gt;
    &lt;/path&gt;
</pre>
can be written as:
<pre>
    &lt;path id=&quot;base.path&quot; path=&quot;${classpath}&quot;/&gt;
</pre>

  <h4><a name="pathshortcut">Path Shortcut</a></h4>
  <p>
    In Ant 1.6 a shortcut for converting paths to OS specific strings
    in properties has been added. One can use the expression 
    ${toString:<em>pathreference</em>} to convert a path element
    reference to a string that can be used for a path argument.
    For example:
  </p>
<pre>
  &lt;path id="lib.path.ref"&gt;
    &lt;fileset dir="lib" includes="*.jar"/&gt;
  &lt;/path&gt;
  &lt;javac srcdir="src" destdir="classes"&gt;
    &lt;compilerarg arg="-Xbootclasspath/p:${toString:lib.path.ref}"/&gt;
  &lt;/javac&gt;
</pre>


<h3><a name="arg">Command-line Arguments</a></h3>
<p>Several tasks take arguments that will be passed to another
process on the command line. To make it easier to specify arguments
that contain space characters, nested <code>arg</code> elements can be used.</p>
<table border="1" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0">
<tr>
  <td width="12%" valign="top"><b>Attribute</b></td>
  <td width="78%" valign="top"><b>Description</b></td>
  <td width="10%" valign="top"><b>Required</b></td>
</tr>
  <tr>
    <td valign="top">value</td>
    <td valign="top">a single command-line argument; can contain space
      characters.</td>
    <td align="center" rowspan="5">Exactly one of these.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td valign="top">file</td>
    <td valign="top">The name of a file as a single command-line
      argument; will be replaced with the absolute filename of the file.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td valign="top">path</td>
    <td valign="top">A string that will be treated as a path-like
      string as a single command-line argument; you can use <code>;</code>
      or <code>:</code> as
      path separators and Ant will convert it to the platform's local
      conventions.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td valign="top">pathref</td>
    <td valign="top"><a href="#references">Reference</a> to a path
      defined elsewhere.  Ant will convert it to the platform's local
      conventions.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td valign="top">line</td>
    <td valign="top">a space-delimited list of command-line arguments.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td valign="top">prefix</td>
    <td valign="top">A fixed string to be placed in front of the
      argument. In the case of a line broken into parts, it will be
      placed in front of every part. <em>Since Ant 1.8.</em></td>
    <td valign="top" align="center">No</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td valign="top">suffix</td>
    <td valign="top">A fixed string to be placed immediately after the
      argument. In the case of a line broken into parts, it will be
      placed after every part. <em>Since Ant 1.8.</em></td>
    <td valign="top" align="center">No</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>It is highly recommended to avoid the <code>line</code> version
when possible.  Ant will try to split the command line in a way
similar to what a (Unix) shell would do, but may create something that
is very different from what you expect under some circumstances.</p>

<h4>Examples</h4>
<blockquote><pre>
  &lt;arg value=&quot;-l -a&quot;/&gt;
</pre></blockquote>
<p>is a single command-line argument containing a space character,
<i>not</i> separate commands "-l" and "-a".</p>
<blockquote><pre>
  &lt;arg line=&quot;-l -a&quot;/&gt;
</pre></blockquote>
<p>This is a command line with two separate arguments, "-l" and "-a".</p>
<blockquote><pre>
  &lt;arg path=&quot;/dir;/dir2:\dir3&quot;/&gt;
</pre></blockquote>
<p>is a single command-line argument with the value
<code>\dir;\dir2;\dir3</code> on DOS-based systems and
<code>/dir:/dir2:/dir3</code> on Unix-like systems.</p>

<h3><a name="references">References</a></h3>

<p>Any project element can be assigned an identifier using its
<code>id</code> attribute. In most cases the element can subsequently
be referenced by specifying the <code>refid</code> attribute on an
element of the same type.  This can be useful if you are going to
replicate the same snippet of XML over and over again--using a
<code>&lt;classpath&gt;</code> structure more than once, for example.</p>
<p>The following example:</p>
<blockquote><pre>
&lt;project ... &gt;
  &lt;target ... &gt;
    &lt;rmic ...&gt;
      &lt;classpath&gt;
        &lt;pathelement location=&quot;lib/&quot;/&gt;
        &lt;pathelement path=&quot;${java.class.path}/&quot;/&gt;
        &lt;pathelement path=&quot;${additional.path}&quot;/&gt;
      &lt;/classpath&gt;
    &lt;/rmic&gt;
  &lt;/target&gt;

  &lt;target ... &gt;
    &lt;javac ...&gt;
      &lt;classpath&gt;
        &lt;pathelement location=&quot;lib/&quot;/&gt;
        &lt;pathelement path=&quot;${java.class.path}/&quot;/&gt;
        &lt;pathelement path=&quot;${additional.path}&quot;/&gt;
      &lt;/classpath&gt;
    &lt;/javac&gt;
  &lt;/target&gt;
&lt;/project&gt;
</pre></blockquote>
<p>could be rewritten as:</p>
<blockquote><pre>
&lt;project ... &gt;
  &lt;path id=&quot;project.class.path&quot;&gt;
    &lt;pathelement location=&quot;lib/&quot;/&gt;
    &lt;pathelement path=&quot;${java.class.path}/&quot;/&gt;
    &lt;pathelement path=&quot;${additional.path}&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;/path&gt;

  &lt;target ... &gt;
    &lt;rmic ...&gt;
      &lt;classpath refid=&quot;project.class.path&quot;/&gt;
    &lt;/rmic&gt;
  &lt;/target&gt;

  &lt;target ... &gt;
    &lt;javac ...&gt;
      &lt;classpath refid=&quot;project.class.path&quot;/&gt;
    &lt;/javac&gt;
  &lt;/target&gt;
&lt;/project&gt;
</pre></blockquote>
<p>All tasks that use nested elements for 
<a href="Types/patternset.html">PatternSet</a>s, 
<a href="Types/fileset.html">FileSet</a>s, 
<a href="Types/zipfileset.html">ZipFileSet</a>s or 
<a href="#path">path-like structures</a> accept references to these structures 
as shown in the examples. Using <code>refid</code> on a task will ordinarily 
have the same effect (referencing a task already declared), but the user 
should be aware that the interpretation of this attribute is dependent on the 
implementation of the element upon which it is specified. Some tasks (the 
<a href="Tasks/property.html">property</a> task is a handy example) 
deliberately assign a different meaning to <code>refid</code>.</p>


<h3><a name="external-tasks">Use of external tasks</a></h3> 
Ant supports a plugin mechanism for using third party tasks. For using them you 
have to do two steps: 
<ol>
  <li>place their implementation somewhere where Ant can find them</li>
  <li>declare them.</li>
</ol> 
Don't add anything to the CLASSPATH environment variable - this is often the  
reason for very obscure errors. Use Ant's own <a href="install.html#optionalTasks">mechanisms</a> 
for adding libraries: 
<ul>
  <li>via command line argument <code>-lib</code></li>
  <li>adding to <code>${user.home}/.ant/lib</code></li>
  <li>adding to <code>${ant.home}/lib</code></li>
</ul>
For the declaration there are several ways:
<ul>
  <li>declare a single task per using instruction using  
      <code>&lt;<a href="Tasks/taskdef.html">taskdef</a> name=&quot;taskname&quot; 
      classname=&quot;ImplementationClass&quot;/&gt;</code>
      <br>
      <code>&lt;taskdef name=&quot;for&quot; classname=&quot;net.sf.antcontrib.logic.For&quot; /&gt; 
      &lt;for ... /&gt;</code>
  </li>
  <li>declare a bundle of tasks using a properties-file holding these 
      taskname-ImplementationClass-pairs and <code>&lt;taskdef&gt;</code>
      <br>
      <code>&lt;taskdef resource=&quot;net/sf/antcontrib/antcontrib.properties&quot; /&gt; 
      &lt;for ... /&gt;</code>
  </li>
  <li>declare a bundle of tasks using a <a href="Types/antlib.html">xml-file</a> holding these  
      taskname-ImplementationClass-pairs and <code>&lt;taskdef&gt;</code>
      <br>
      <code>&lt;taskdef resource=&quot;net/sf/antcontrib/antlib.xml&quot; /&gt; 
      &lt;for ... /&gt;</code>
  </li>
