<h2><a name="manifestclasspath">Manifestclasspath</a></h2>

<h3>Description</h3>
<p>Converts a <a href="../using.html#path">Path</a> into a property
whose value is appropriate for a <a href="manifest.html">Manifest</a>'s
<code>Class-Path</code> attribute.</p>

<p>This task is often used to work around command line limitations on Windows
when using very long class paths when launching an application. The long class
path normally specified on the command line is replaced by a single (possibly
empty) jar file which an in-manifest Class-Path attribute whose value lists
all the jar and zip files the class path should contain. The files referenced
from this attribute must be found relatively to the jar file itself, usually
in the same directory. The Java VM automically uses all file entries listed
in the Class-Path attributes of a jar to locate/load classes. Note though that
it silently ignores entries for which it cannot find any corresponding file.</p>

<p>Note that the property value created may be longer than a manifest's maximum
72 characters per line, but will be properly wrapped as per the Jar
specification by the <code>&lt;manifest&gt;</code> element, where the
defined property is re-referenced.</p>

<p>For this task to work properly the relative path from the file
  given in the <code>jarfile</code> attribute to the elements of the
  nested <code>classpath</code> must be the same as you expect them to
  be when deploying the jar.</p>

<p><em>since Apache Ant 1.7</em></p>

<h3>Parameters</h3>
<table border="1" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0">
  <tr>
    <td valign="top"><b>Attribute</b></td>
    <td valign="top"><b>Description</b></td>
    <td align="center" valign="top"><b>Required</b></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td valign="top">property</td>
    <td valign="top">the name of the property to set. This property must
                     not already be set.</td>
    <td valign="top" align="center">Yes</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td valign="top">jarfile</td>
    <td valign="top">
      the filename for the Jar which will contain the manifest that will
      use the property this task will set. This file need not exist yet,
      but its parent directory must exist.
    </td>
    <td valign="top" align="center">Yes</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td valign="top">maxParentLevels</td>
    <td valign="top">
      The maximum number of parent directories one is allowed to traverse
      to navigate from the jar file to the path entry. Put differently, the
      maximum number of .. which is allowed in the relative path from the
      jar file to a given class path enty. Specify 0 to enforce a path
      entry to be in the same directory (or one of its sub-directories)
      as the jar file itself.  Defaults to 2 levels.</td>
    <td valign="top" align="center">No</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<h3>Parameters specified as nested elements</h3>
<h4>classpath</h4>
<p>A <a href="../using.html#path">Path-like</a> element, which can be
defined in-place, or refer to a path defined elsewhere using the
<code>&lt;classpath refid="<em>pathid</em>" /&gt;</code> syntax.
This classpath must not be empty, and is required.</p>

<h3>Examples</h3>
<div id="example1">
  <blockquote><pre>
    &lt;manifestclasspath property="jar.classpath"
                       jarfile="build/acme.jar"&gt;
      &lt;classpath refid="classpath" /&gt;
    &lt;/manifestclasspath&gt;
  </pre></blockquote>
  <p>Assuming a path of id "classpath" was already defined, convert this
  path relatively to the build/ directory that will contain acme.jar, which
  can later be created with <code>&lt;jar&gt;</code> with a nested 
  <code>&lt;manifest&gt;</code> element that lists an
  <code>&lt;attribute name="Class-Path" value="${jar.classpath}" /&gt;</code>.
  </p>
</div>
