  <title>Exec Task</title>
</head>

<body>

<h2><a name="exec">Exec</a></h2>
<h3>Description</h3>
<p>Executes a system command. When the <i>os</i> attribute is specified, then
the command is only executed when Apache Ant is run on one of the specified operating
systems.</p>

<p>Note that you cannot interact with the forked program, the only way
to send input to it is via the input and inputstring attributes. Also note that
since Ant 1.6, any attempt to read input in the forked program will receive an
EOF (-1). This is a change from Ant 1.5, where such an attempt would block.</p>

<p>If you want to execute an executable using a path relative to the
  project's basedir, you may need to
  use <code>vmlauncher="false"</code> on some operating systems - but
  even this may fail (Solaris 8/9 has been reported as problematic).
  The <code>resolveexecutable</code> attribute should be more
  reliable, as would be something like
<pre>
  &lt;property name="executable-full-path"
            location="../relative/path/to/executable"/&gt;
  &lt;exec executable="${executable-full-path}" ...
</pre>
</p>

<h4>Windows Users</h4>
<p>The <code>&lt;exec&gt;</code> task delegates to <code>Runtime.exec</code> which in turn
apparently calls <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/dllproc/base/createprocess.asp">
<code>::CreateProcess</code></a>. It is the latter Win32 function that defines
the exact semantics of the call. In particular, if you do not put a file extension
on the executable, only ".EXE" files are looked for, not ".COM", ".CMD" or other file
types listed in the environment variable PATHEXT. That is only used by the shell.
</p>
  <p>
    Note that <em>.bat</em> files cannot in general by executed directly.
    One normally needs to execute the command shell executable <code>cmd</code>
    using the <code>/c</code> switch.
  </p>
  <blockquote>
<pre>
&lt;target name="help"&gt;
  &lt;exec executable="cmd"&gt;
    &lt;arg value="/c"/&gt;
    &lt;arg value="ant.bat"/&gt;
    &lt;arg value="-p"/&gt;
  &lt;/exec&gt;
&lt;/target&gt;
</pre></blockquote>

<p>A common problem is not having the executable on the PATH. In case you get an error
message <tt>Cannot run program "...":CreateProcess error=2. The system cannot find
the path specified.</tt> have a look at your PATH variable. Just type the command directly on
the command line and if Windows finds it, Ant should do it too. (Otherwise ask on the user mailinglist for help.) If Windows can not execute the program add the directory of the programm
to the PATH (<tt>set PATH=%PATH%;dirOfProgram</tt>) or specify the absolute path in the
<tt>executable</tt> attribute in your buildfile.
</p>


<h4>Cygwin Users</h4>
<p>The <code>&lt;exec&gt;</code> task will not understand paths such as /bin/sh
for the executable parameter.  This is because the Java VM in which Ant is
running is a standard Windows executable and is not aware of the Cygwin
environment (i.e., doesn't load <code>cygwin1.dll</code>).  The only
work-around for this is to compile a JVM under Cygwin (at your own risk).
See for instance 
<a href="http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/build/README-builds.html#cygwin">
sun jdk 6 build instructions for cygwin</a>.
</p>

<h4>OpenVMS Users</h4>
<p>The command specified using <code>executable</code> and
<code>&lt;arg&gt;</code> elements is executed exactly as specified
inside a temporary DCL script.  This has some implications:
<ul>
<li>paths have to be written in VMS style</li>
<li>if your <code>executable</code> points to a DCL script remember to
prefix it with an <code>@</code>-sign
(e.g. <code>executable="@[FOO]BAR.COM"</code>), just as you would in a
DCL script</li>
</ul>
For <code>&lt;exec&gt;</code> to work in an environment with a Java VM
older than version 1.4.1-2 it is also <i>required</i> that the logical
<code>JAVA$FORK_SUPPORT_CHDIR</code> is set to <code>TRUE</code> in
the job table (see the <i>JDK Release Notes</i>).</p>

<p>Please note that the Java VM provided by HP doesn't follow OpenVMS'
conventions of exit codes.  If you run a Java VM with this task, the
task may falsely claim that an error occurred (or silently ignore an
error).  Don't use this task to run <code>JAVA.EXE</code>, use a
<code>&lt;java&gt;</code> task with the <code>fork</code> attribute
set to <code>true</code> instead as this task will follow the VM's
interpretation of exit codes.</p>

<h4>RedHat S/390 Users</h4>

<p>It has been <a
href="http://listserv.uark.edu/scripts/wa.exe?A1=ind0404&L=vmesa-l#33">reported
on the VMESA-LISTSERV</a> that shell scripts invoked via the Ant Exec
task must have their interpreter specified, i.e., the scripts must
start with something like:

<blockquote>
<pre>
#!/bin/bash
</pre>
</blockquote>

or the task will fail as follows:

<blockquote>
<pre>
[exec] Warning: UNIXProcess.forkAndExec native error: Exec format error
[exec] Result: 255
</pre>
</blockquote>
</p>

<h4><a name="background">Running Ant as a background process on
    Unix(-like) systems</a></h4>

<p>If you run Ant as a background process (like <code>ant &</code>)
  and use the <code>&lt;exec&gt;</code> task with <code>spawn</code>
  set to <code>false</code>, you must provide explicit input to the
  forked process or Ant will be suspended because it tries to read
  from the standard input.</p>

<a name="redirector"><h4>redirector</h4></a>
<i><b>Since Ant 1.6.2</b></i>
<p>A nested <a href="../Types/redirector.html">I/O Redirector</a>
can be specified.  In general, the attributes of the redirector behave
as the corresponding attributes available at the task level.  The most
notable peculiarity stems from the retention of the &lt;exec&gt;
attributes for backwards compatibility.  Any file mapping is done
using a <CODE>null</CODE> sourcefile; therefore not all
<a href="../Types/mapper.html">Mapper</a> types will return
results.  When no results are returned, redirection specifications
will fall back to the task level attributes.  In practice this means that
defaults can be specified for input, output, and error output files.
</p>
<h3>Errors and return codes</h3>
By default the return code of a <code>&lt;exec&gt;</code> is ignored; when you set
<code>failonerror="true"</code> then any return code signaling failure
(OS specific) causes the build to fail. Alternatively, you can set
<code>resultproperty</code> to the name of a property and have it assigned to
the result code (barring immutability, of course).
<p>
If the attempt to start the program fails with an OS dependent error code,
then <code>&lt;exec&gt;</code> halts the build unless <code>failifexecutionfails</code>
is set to <code>false</code>. You can use that to run a program if it exists, but
otherwise do nothing.
<p>
What do those error codes mean? Well, they are OS dependent. On Windows
boxes you have to look at
<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/debug/base/system_error_codes__0-499_.asp">
the documentation</a>; error code 2 means 'no such program', which usually means
it is not on the path. Any time you see such an error from any Ant task, it is
usually not an Ant bug, but some configuration problem on your machine.

<h3>Examples</h3>
<blockquote><pre>
&lt;exec executable=&quot;emacs&quot;&gt;
  &lt;env key=&quot;DISPLAY&quot; value=&quot;:1.0&quot;/&gt;
&lt;/exec&gt;
</pre></blockquote>
<p>starts <code>emacs</code> on display 1 of the X Window System.</p>

<blockquote><pre>
&lt;property environment=&quot;env&quot;/&gt;
&lt;exec ... &gt;
  &lt;env key=&quot;PATH&quot; path=&quot;${env.PATH}:${basedir}/bin&quot;/&gt;
&lt;/exec&gt;
</pre></blockquote>
<p>adds <code>${basedir}/bin</code> to the <code>PATH</code> of the
system command.</p>

<blockquote><pre>
&lt;property name="browser" location="C:/Program Files/Internet Explorer/iexplore.exe"/&gt;
&lt;property name="file" location="ant/docs/manual/index.html"/&gt;

&lt;exec executable="${browser}" spawn="true"&gt;
    &lt;arg value="${file}"/&gt;
&lt;/exec&gt;
</pre></blockquote>
<p>Starts the <i>${browser}</i> with the specified <i>${file}</i> and end the
Ant process. The browser will remain.</p>

<blockquote><pre>
&lt;exec executable=&quot;cat&quot;&gt;
    &lt;redirector outputproperty=&quot;redirector.out&quot;
                errorproperty=&quot;redirector.err&quot;
                inputstring=&quot;blah before blah&quot;&gt;
        &lt;inputfilterchain&gt;
            &lt;replacestring from=&quot;before&quot; to=&quot;after&quot;/&gt;
        &lt;/inputfilterchain&gt;
        &lt;outputmapper type=&quot;merge&quot; to=&quot;redirector.out&quot;/&gt;
        &lt;errormapper type=&quot;merge&quot; to=&quot;redirector.err&quot;/&gt;
    &lt;/redirector&gt;
&lt;/exec&gt;
</pre></blockquote>

Sends the string &quot;blah before blah&quot; to the &quot;cat&quot; executable,
using an <a href="../Types/filterchain.html">&lt;inputfilterchain&gt;</a>
to replace &quot;before&quot; with &quot;after&quot; on the way in.
Output is sent to the file &quot;redirector.out&quot; and stored
in a property of the same name.  Similarly, error output is sent to
a file and a property, both named &quot;redirector.err&quot;.


<p><b>Note:</b> do not try to specify arguments using
a simple arg-element and separate them by spaces. This results in
only a single argument containing the entire string.</p>
<p>
<b>Timeouts: </b> If a timeout is specified, when it is reached the
sub process is killed and a message printed to the log. The return
value of the execution will be "-1", which will halt the build if
<tt>failonerror=true</tt>, but be ignored otherwise.
