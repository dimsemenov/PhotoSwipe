<title>Recorder Task</title>
</head>

<body>

<h2><a name="log">Record</a></h2>
<h3>Description</h3>
<p>A recorder is a listener to the current build process that records the
output to a file.</p>

<p>Several recorders can exist at the same time.  Each recorder is
associated with a file.  The filename is used as a unique identifier for
the recorders.  The first call to the recorder task with an unused filename
will create a recorder (using the parameters provided) and add it to the
listeners of the build.  All subsequent calls to the recorder task using
this filename will modify that recorders state (recording or not) or other
properties (like logging level).</p>

<p>Some technical issues: the file's print stream is flushed for &quot;finished&quot;
events (buildFinished, targetFinished and taskFinished), and is closed on
a buildFinished event.</p>

<h3>Parameters</h3>
<table border="1" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0">
  <tr>
    <td valign="top"><b>Attribute</b></td>
    <td valign="top"><b>Description</b></td>
    <td align="center" valign="top"><b>Required</b></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td valign="top">name</td>
    <td valign="top">The name of the file this logger is associated with.</td>
    <td align="center" valign="middle">yes</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td valign="top">action</td>
    <td valign="top">This tells the logger what to do: should it start
    recording or stop?  The first time that the recorder task is called for
    this logfile, and if this attribute is not provided, then the default
    for this attribute is &quot;start&quot;.  If this attribute is not provided on
    subsequent calls, then the state remains as previous.
    [Values = {start|stop}, Default = no state change]</td>
    <td align="center" valign="middle">no</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td valign="top">append</td>
    <td valign="top">Should the recorder append to a file, or create a new
    one? This is only applicable the first time this task is called for
    this file.  [Values = {yes|no}, Default=no]</td>
    <td align="center" valign="middle">no</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td valign="top">emacsmode</td>
    <td valign="top">Removes <code>[task]</code> banners like Apache Ant's
    <code>-emacs</code> command line switch if set to
    <em>true</em>.</td>
    <td align="center" valign="middle">no, default is <em>false</em></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td valign="top">loglevel</td>
    <td valign="top">At what logging level should this recorder instance
    record to?  This is not a once only parameter (like <code>append</code>
    is) -- you can increase or decrease the logging level as the build process
    continues.  [Values= {error|warn|info|verbose|debug}, Default = no change]
    </td>
    <td align="center" valign="middle">no</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<h3>Examples</h3>
<p>The following build.xml snippet is an example of how to use the recorder
to record just the <code>&lt;javac&gt;</code> task:</p>
<pre>
    ...
    &lt;compile &gt;
        &lt;record name=&quot;log.txt&quot; action=&quot;start&quot;/&gt;
        &lt;javac ...
        &lt;record name=&quot;log.txt&quot; action=&quot;stop&quot;/&gt;
    &lt;compile/&gt;
    ...
</pre>

<p>The following two calls to <code>&lt;record&gt;</code> set up two
recorders: one to file &quot;records-simple.log&quot; at logging level <code>info</code>
(the default) and one to file &quot;ISO.log&quot; using logging level of
<code>verbose</code>.</p>
<pre>
    ...
    &lt;record name=&quot;records-simple.log&quot;/&gt;
    &lt;record name=&quot;ISO.log&quot; loglevel=&quot;verbose&quot;/&gt;
    ...
</pre>

<h3>Notes</h3>
<p>There is some functionality that I would like to be able to add in the
future.  They include things like the following:</p>
<table border="1" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0">
  <tr>
    <td valign="top"><b>Attribute</b></td>
    <td valign="top"><b>Description</b></td>
    <td align="center" valign="top"><b>Required</b></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td valign="top">listener</td>
    <td valign="top">A classname of a build listener to use from this point
    on instead of the default listener.</td>
    <td align="center" valign="middle">no</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td valign="top">includetarget</td>
    <td valign="top" rowspan=2>A comma-separated list of targets to automatically
    record.  If this value is &quot;all&quot;, then all targets are recorded.
    [Default = all]</td>
    <td align="center" valign="middle">no</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td valign="top">excludetarget</td>
    <td align="center" valign="middle">no</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td valign="top">includetask</td>
    <td valign="top" rowspan=2>A comma-separated list of task to automatically
    record or not.  This could be difficult as it could conflict with the
    <code>includetarget/excludetarget</code>.  (e.g.:
    <code>includetarget=&quot;compile&quot; exlcudetask=&quot;javac&quot;</code>, what should
    happen?)</td>
    <td align="center" valign="middle">no</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td valign="top">excludetask</td>
    <td align="center" valign="middle">no</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td valign="top">action</td>
    <td valign="top">add greater flexibility to the action attribute.  Things
    like <code>close</code> to close the print stream.</td>
    <td align="center" valign="top">no</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td valign="top"></td>
    <td valign="top"></td>
    <td align="center" valign="top"></td>
  </tr>
</table>
