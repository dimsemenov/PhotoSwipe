<title>Jar Task</title>
</head>

<body>

<h2><a name="jar">Jar</a></h2>
<h3>Description</h3>
<p>Jars a set of files.</p>
<p>The <i>basedir</i> attribute is the reference directory from where to jar.</p>
<p>Note that file permissions will not be stored in the resulting jarfile.</p>
<p>It is possible to refine the set of files that are being jarred. This can be
done with the <i>includes</i>, <i>includesfile</i>, <i>excludes</i>, <i>excludesfile</i> and <i>defaultexcludes</i>
attributes. With the <i>includes</i> or <i>includesfile</i> attribute you specify the files you want to
have included by using patterns. The <i>exclude</i> or <i>excludesfile</i> attribute is used to specify
the files you want to have excluded. This is also done with patterns. And
finally with the <i>defaultexcludes</i> attribute, you can specify whether you
want to use default exclusions or not. See the section on <a
href="../dirtasks.html#directorybasedtasks">directory based tasks</a>, on how the
inclusion/exclusion of files works, and how to write patterns.</p>
<p>This task forms an implicit <a href="../Types/fileset.html">FileSet</a> and
supports most attributes of <code>&lt;fileset&gt;</code>
(<code>dir</code> becomes <code>basedir</code>) as well as the nested
<code>&lt;include&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;exclude&gt;</code> and
<code>&lt;patternset&gt;</code> elements.</p>
<p>You can also use nested file sets for more flexibility, and specify
multiple ones to merge together different trees of files into one JAR.
The extended fileset and groupfileset child elements from the zip task are
also available in the jar task.
See the <a href="zip.html">Zip</a> task for more details and examples.</p>
<p>If the manifest is omitted, a simple one will be supplied by Apache Ant.</p>

<p>The <code>update</code> parameter controls what happens if the JAR
file already exists. When set to <code>yes</code>, the JAR file is
updated with the files specified. When set to <code>no</code> (the
default) the JAR file is overwritten. An example use of this is
provided in the <a href="zip.html">Zip task documentation</a>.  Please
note that ZIP files store file modification times with a granularity
of two seconds.  If a file is less than two seconds newer than the
entry in the archive, Ant will not consider it newer.</p>

<p>The <code>whenmanifestonly</code> parameter controls what happens when no
files, apart from the manifest file, or nested services, match.
If <code>skip</code>, the JAR is not created and a warning is issued.
If <code>fail</code>, the JAR is not created and the build is halted with an error.
If <code>create</code>, (default) an empty JAR file (only containing a manifest and services)
is created.</p>

<p>(The Jar task is a shortcut for specifying the manifest file of a JAR file.
The same thing can be accomplished by using the <i>fullpath</i>
attribute of a zipfileset in a Zip task. The one difference is that if the
<i>manifest</i> attribute is not specified, the Jar task will
include an empty one for you.)</p>

<p>Manifests are processed by the Jar task according to the
<a target="_blank" href="http://download.oracle.com/javase/1.5.0/docs/guide/jar/jar.html">Jar file specification.</a>
Note in particular that this may result in manifest lines greater than 72 bytes
being wrapped and continued on the next line.</p>

<p>The Jar task checks whether you specified package information according to the
<a target="_blank" href="http://download.oracle.com/javase/1.3/docs/guide/versioning/spec/VersioningSpecification.html#PackageVersioning">
versioning specification</a>.</p>

<p><b>Please note that the zip format allows multiple files of the same
fully-qualified name to exist within a single archive. This has been
documented as causing various problems for unsuspecting users. If you wish
to avoid this behavior you must set the <code>duplicate</code> attribute
to a value other than its default, <code>"add"</code>.</b></p>

    rerun the task, so the default is to round up.  Rounding up may
    lead to a different type of problems like JSPs inside a web

<h3>Nested elements</h3>
<h4>metainf</h4>
<p>The nested <code>metainf</code> element specifies a <a
href="../Types/fileset.html">FileSet</a>. All files included in this fileset will
end up in the <code>META-INF</code> directory of the jar file. If this
fileset includes a file named <code>MANIFEST.MF</code>, the file is
ignored and you will get a warning.</p>

<h4>manifest</h4>
<p>The manifest nested element allows the manifest for the Jar file to
be provided inline in the build file rather than in an external
file. This element is identical to the
<a href="manifest.html">manifest</a> task, but the file and mode
attributes must be omitted.</p>
<p>
If both an inline manifest and an external file are both specified, the
manifests are merged.
</p>

<p>When using inline manifests, the Jar task will check whether the manifest
contents have changed (i.e. the manifest as specified is different in any way
from the manifest that exists in the Jar, if it exists.
If the manifest values have changed the jar will be updated or rebuilt, as
appropriate.
</p>

<a name="indexjars"><h4>indexjars</h4></a>

<p><em>since ant 1.6.2</em></p>

<p>The nested <code>indexjars</code> element specifies a <a
href="../using.html#path">PATH like structure</a>.  Its content is
completely ignored unless you set the index attribute of the task to
true.</p>

<p>The index created by this task will contain indices for the
archives contained in this path, the names used for the archives
depend on your manifest:</p>
<ul>
  <li>If the generated jar's manifest contains no Class-Path
  attribute, the file name without any leading directory path will be
  used and all parts of the path will get indexed.</li>
  <li>If the manifest contains a Class-Path attribute, this task will
  try to guess which part of the Class-Path belongs to a given
  archive.  If it cannot guess a name, the archive will be skipped,
  otherwise the name listed inside the Class-Path attribute will be
  used.</li>
</ul>

<p>This task will not create any index entries for archives that are
  empty or only contain files inside the META-INF directory unless
  the <code>indexmetainf</code> attribute has been set
  to <code>true</code>.</p>

<a name="service"><h4>service</h4></a>

<p><em>since ant 1.7.0</em></p>

<p>
  The nested <code>service</code> element specifies a service.
  Services are described by
  <a href="http://download.oracle.com/javase/1.5.0/docs/guide/jar/jar.html#Service%20Provider">http://download.oracle.com/javase/1.5.0/docs/guide/jar/jar.html#Service%20Provider</a>.
  The approach is to have providers JARs include files named by the service
  provided, for example,
  META-INF/services/javax.script.ScriptEngineFactory
  which can include implementation class names, one per line (usually just one per JAR).

  The name of the
  service is set by the "type" attribute. The classname implementing
  the service is the the "provider" attribute, or it one wants to
  specify a number of classes that implement the service, by
  "provider" nested elements.
</p>
<p>
<table border="1" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0">
  <tr>
    <td valign="top"><b>Attribute</b></td>
    <td valign="top"><b>Description</b></td>
    <td align="center" valign="top"><b>Required</b></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td valign="top">type</td>
    <td valign="top">The name of the service.</td>
    <td valign="top" align="center">Yes</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td valign="top">provider</td>
    <td valign="top">
      The classname of the class implementing the service.
    </td>
    <td valign="top" align="center">Yes, unless there is a nested
      <code>&lt;provider&gt;</code> element.</td>
  </tr>
</table>
  <p>
    The provider classname is specified either by the "provider" attribute, or
    by a nested &lt;provider&gt; element, which has a single "classname" attribute.
    If a JAR file has more that one implementation of the service, a number of
    nested &lt;provider&gt; elements may be used.
  </p>
  
  
<h3>Examples</h3>

<h4>Simple</h4>
<blockquote><pre>  &lt;jar destfile=&quot;${dist}/lib/app.jar&quot; basedir=&quot;${build}/classes&quot;/&gt;</pre></blockquote>
<p>jars all files in the <code>${build}/classes</code> directory into a file
called <code>app.jar</code> in the <code>${dist}/lib</code> directory.</p>


<h4>With filters</h4>

<blockquote><pre>  &lt;jar destfile=&quot;${dist}/lib/app.jar&quot;
       basedir=&quot;${build}/classes&quot;
       excludes=&quot;**/Test.class&quot;
  /&gt;</pre></blockquote>
<p>jars all files in the <code>${build}/classes</code> directory into a file
called <code>app.jar</code> in the <code>${dist}/lib</code> directory. Files
with the name <code>Test.class</code> are excluded.</p>

<blockquote><pre>  &lt;jar destfile=&quot;${dist}/lib/app.jar&quot;
       basedir=&quot;${build}/classes&quot;
       includes=&quot;mypackage/test/**&quot;
       excludes=&quot;**/Test.class&quot;
  /&gt;</pre></blockquote>
<p>jars all files in the <code>${build}/classes</code> directory into a file
called <code>app.jar</code> in the <code>${dist}/lib</code> directory. Only
files under the directory <code>mypackage/test</code> are used, and files with
the name <code>Test.class</code> are excluded.</p>

<h4>Multiple filesets</h4>
<blockquote><pre>  &lt;jar destfile=&quot;${dist}/lib/app.jar&quot;&gt;
    &lt;fileset dir=&quot;${build}/classes&quot;
             excludes=&quot;**/Test.class&quot;
    /&gt;
    &lt;fileset dir=&quot;${src}/resources&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;/jar&gt;</pre></blockquote>
<p>jars all files in the <code>${build}/classes</code> directory and also
in the <code>${src}/resources</code> directory together into a file
called <code>app.jar</code> in the <code>${dist}/lib</code> directory.
Files with the name <code>Test.class</code> are excluded.
If there are files such as <code>${build}/classes/mypackage/MyClass.class</code>
and <code>${src}/resources/mypackage/image.gif</code>, they will appear
in the same directory in the JAR (and thus be considered in the same package
by Java).</p>

<h4>Merging archives</h4>

<blockquote><pre> &lt;jar destfile="build/main/checksites.jar"&gt;
    &lt;fileset dir="build/main/classes"/&gt;
    &lt;zipfileset includes="**/*.class" src="lib/main/some.jar"/&gt;
    &lt;manifest&gt;
      &lt;attribute name="Main-Class"
            value="com.acme.checksites.Main"/&gt;
    &lt;/manifest&gt;
  &lt;/jar&gt;</pre></blockquote>
<p>
  Creates an executable jar file with a main class "com.acme.checksites.Main", and
  embeds all the classes from the jar <code>lib/main/some.jar</code>.
</p>

<blockquote><pre> &lt;jar destfile="build/main/checksites.jar"&gt;
    &lt;fileset dir="build/main/classes"/&gt;
    &lt;restrict&gt;
     &lt;name name="**/*.class"/&gt;
     &lt;archives&gt;
       &lt;zips&gt;
         &lt;fileset dir="lib/main" includes="**/*.jar"/&gt;
       &lt;/zips&gt;
     &lt;/archives&gt;
    &lt;/restrict&gt;
    &lt;manifest&gt;
      &lt;attribute name="Main-Class"
            value="com.acme.checksites.Main"/&gt;
    &lt;/manifest&gt;
  &lt;/jar&gt;</pre></blockquote>
<p>
  Creates an executable jar file with a main class "com.acme.checksites.Main", and
  embeds all the classes from all the jars in <code>lib/main</code>.
</p>

<h4>Inline manifest</h4>
<blockquote><pre>  &lt;jar destfile=&quot;test.jar&quot; basedir=&quot;.&quot;&gt;
    &lt;include name=&quot;build&quot;/&gt;
    &lt;manifest&gt;
      &lt;!-- Who is building this jar? --&gt;
      &lt;attribute name=&quot;Built-By&quot; value=&quot;${user.name}&quot;/&gt;
      &lt;!-- Information about the program itself --&gt;
      &lt;attribute name=&quot;Implementation-Vendor&quot; value=&quot;ACME inc.&quot;/&gt;
      &lt;attribute name=&quot;Implementation-Title&quot; value=&quot;GreatProduct&quot;/&gt;
      &lt;attribute name=&quot;Implementation-Version&quot; value=&quot;1.0.0beta2&quot;/&gt;
      &lt;!-- details --&gt;
      &lt;section name=&quot;common/MyClass.class&quot;&gt;
        &lt;attribute name=&quot;Sealed&quot; value=&quot;false&quot;/&gt;
      &lt;/section&gt;
    &lt;/manifest&gt;
  &lt;/jar&gt;</pre></blockquote>
<p>
This is an example of an inline manifest specification including the version of the build
program (Implementation-Version). Note that the Built-By attribute will take the value of the Ant 
property ${user.name}. The manifest produced by the above would look like this:
</p>

<blockquote><pre><code>Manifest-Version: 1.0
Built-By: conor
Implementation-Vendor: ACME inc.
Implementation-Title: GreatProduct
Implementation-Version: 1.0.0beta2
Created-By: Apache Ant 1.7.0

Name: common/MyClass.class
Sealed: false</code></pre></blockquote>

<h4>Service Provider</h4>

<p>
  The following shows how to create a jar file specifing a service
  with an implementation of the JDK6 scripting interface:
</p>
<blockquote><pre>&lt;jar jarfile="pinky.jar"&gt;
  &lt;fileset dir="build/classes"/&gt;
  &lt;service type="javax.script.ScriptEngineFactory"
           provider="org.acme.PinkyLanguage"/&gt;
&lt;/jar&gt;
</pre></blockquote>



<p>
  The following shows how to create a jar file specifing a service
  with two implementations of the JDK6 scripting interface:
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
