<h2><a name="componentdef">componentdef</a></h2>
<h3>Description</h3>
  <p>
    Adds a component definition to the current project.
    A compenent definition is the same as a
    <a href="typedef.html">typedef</a> except:
  </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        that it can only be used in other types or tasks that
        accept components (by having an <i>add()</i> method).
      </li>
      <li>
        multiple components may have the same name, provided they
        implement different interfaces.
      </li>
    </ol>
  <p>
    The purpose of this is to allow internal Apache Ant definitions to be
    made for tags like "and" or "or".
  </p>

  <h3>Examples</h3>

<pre> &lt;componentdef name="or" onerror="ignore"
    classname="com.apache.tools.ant.taskdefs.conditions.Or"/&gt;
  &lt;componentdef name="or" onerror="ignore"
    classname="com.apache.tools.ant.types.resources.selectors.Or"/&gt;</pre>
  <p>
    defines two components with the same name "or"; one is a condition
    (see <a href="conditions.html">conditions</a>) and one is 
    a selector (see <a href="../Types/selectors.html">selectors</a>).
