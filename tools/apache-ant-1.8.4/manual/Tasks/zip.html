<h2><a name="zip">Zip</a></h2>
<h3>Description</h3>
<p>Creates a zipfile.</p>
<p>The <i>basedir</i> attribute is the reference directory from where to zip.</p>
<p>Note that file permissions will not be stored in the resulting zipfile.</p>
<p>It is possible to refine the set of files that are being zipped. This can be
done with the <i>includes</i>, <i>includesfile</i>, <i>excludes</i>, <i>excludesfile</i> and <i>defaultexcludes</i>
attributes. With the <i>includes</i> or <i>includesfile</i> attribute you specify the files you want to
have included by using patterns. The <i>exclude</i> or <i>excludesfile</i> attribute is used to specify
the files you want to have excluded. This is also done with patterns. And
finally with the <i>defaultexcludes</i> attribute, you can specify whether you
want to use default exclusions or not. See the section on <a
href="../dirtasks.html#directorybasedtasks">directory based tasks</a>, on how the
inclusion/exclusion of files works, and how to write patterns. </p>
<p>This task forms an implicit <a href="../Types/fileset.html">FileSet</a> and
supports most attributes of <code>&lt;fileset&gt;</code>
(<code>dir</code> becomes <code>basedir</code>) as well as the nested
<code>&lt;include&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;exclude&gt;</code> and
<code>&lt;patternset&gt;</code> elements.</p>
<p>Or, you may place within it nested file sets, or references to file sets.
In this case <code>basedir</code> is optional; the implicit file set is <i>only used</i>
if <code>basedir</code> is set. You may use any mixture of the implicit file set
(with <code>basedir</code> set, and optional attributes like <code>includes</code>
and optional subelements like <code>&lt;include&gt;</code>); explicit nested
<code>&lt;fileset&gt;</code> elements so long as at least one fileset total is specified. The ZIP file will
only reflect the relative paths of files <i>within</i> each fileset. The Zip task and its derivatives know a special form of a fileset named zipfileset that has additional attributes (described below). </p>
<p>The Zip task also supports the merging of multiple zip files into the zip file. 
This is possible through either the <i>src</i> attribute of any nested filesets 
or by using the special nested fileset <i>zipgroupfileset</i>.</p>

<p>The <code>update</code> parameter controls what happens if the ZIP
file already exists. When set to <code>yes</code>, the ZIP file is
updated with the files specified. (New files are added; old files are
replaced with the new versions.) When set to <code>no</code> (the
default) the ZIP file is overwritten if any of the files that would be
added to the archive are newer than the entries inside the archive.
Please note that ZIP files store file modification times with a
granularity of two seconds.  If a file is less than two seconds newer
than the entry in the archive, Apache Ant will not consider it newer.</p>

<p>The <code>whenempty</code> parameter controls what happens when no files match.
If <code>skip</code> (the default), the ZIP is not created and a warning is issued.
If <code>fail</code>, the ZIP is not created and the build is halted with an error.
If <code>create</code>, an empty ZIP file (explicitly zero entries) is created,
which should be recognized as such by compliant ZIP manipulation tools.</p>
<p>This task will now use the platform's default character encoding
for filenames - this is consistent with the command line ZIP tools,
but causes problems if you try to open them from within Java and your
filenames contain non US-ASCII characters. Use the encoding attribute
and set it to UTF8 to create zip files that can safely be read by
Java.  For a more complete discussion,
see <a href="#encoding">below</a></p>

<p>Starting with Ant 1.5.2, <code>&lt;zip&gt;</code> can store Unix permissions
inside the archive (see description of the filemode and dirmode
attributes for <a href="../Types/zipfileset.html">&lt;zipfileset&gt;</a>).
Unfortunately there is no portable way to store these permissions.
Ant uses the algorithm used by <a href="http://www.info-zip.org">Info-Zip's</a>
implementation of the zip and unzip commands - these are the default
versions of zip and unzip for many Unix and Unix-like systems.</p>

<p><b>Please note that the zip format allows multiple files of the same
fully-qualified name to exist within a single archive.  This has been
documented as causing various problems for unsuspecting users.  If you wish
to avoid this behavior you must set the <code>duplicate</code> attribute
to a value other than its default, <code>&quot;add&quot;</code>.</b></p>

<p><b>Please also note</b> that different ZIP tools handle timestamps
differently when it comes to applying timezone offset calculations of
files.  Some ZIP libraries will store the timestamps as they've been
read from the filesystem while others will modify the timestamps both
when reading and writing the files to make all timestamps use the same
timezone.  A ZIP archive created by one library may extract files with
"wrong timestamps" when extracted by another library.</p>

<p>Ant's ZIP classes use the same algorithm as the InfoZIP tools and
zlib (timestamps get adjusted), Windows' "compressed folders" function
and WinZIP don't change the timestamps.  This means that using the
unzip task on files created by Windows' compressed folders function
may create files with timestamps that are "wrong", the same is true if
you use Windows' functions to extract an Ant generated ZIP
archive.</p>

<h3><a name="encoding">Encoding of File Names</a></h3>

<p>Traditionally the ZIP archive format uses CodePage 437 as encoding
  for file name, which is not sufficient for many international
  character sets.</p>

<p>Over time different archivers have chosen different ways to work
  around the limitation - the <code>java.util.zip</code> packages
  simply uses UTF-8 as its encoding for example.</p>

<p>Ant has been offering the encoding attribute of the zip and unzip
  task as a way to explicitly specify the encoding to use (or expect)
  since Ant 1.4.  It defaults to the platform's default encoding for
  zip and UTF-8 for jar and other jar-like tasks (war, ear, ...) as
  well as the unzip family of tasks.</p>

<p>More recent versions of the ZIP specification introduce something
  called the &quot;language encoding flag&quot; which can be used to
  signal that a file name has been encoded using UTF-8.  Starting with
  Ant 1.8.0 all zip-/jar- and similar archives written by Ant will set
  this flag, if the encoding has been set to UTF-8.  Our
  interoperabilty tests with existing archivers didn't show any ill
  effects (in fact, most archivers ignore the flag to date), but you
  can turn off the "language encoding flag" by setting the attribute
  <code>useLanguageEncodingFlag</code> to <code>false</code> on the
  zip-task if you should encounter problems.</p>

<p>The unzip (and similar tasks) -task will recognize the language
  encoding flag and ignore the encoding set on the task if it has been
  found.</p>

<p>The InfoZIP developers have introduced new ZIP extra fields that
  can be used to add an additional UTF-8 encoded file name to the
  entry's metadata.  Most archivers ignore these extra fields.  The
  zip family of tasks support an
  option <code>createUnicodeExtraFields</code> since Ant 1.8.0 which
  makes Ant write these extra fields either for all entries ("always")
  or only those whose name cannot be encoded using the spcified
  encoding (not-encodeable), it defaults to "never" since the extra
  fields create bigger archives.</p>

<p>The fallbackToUTF8 attribute of zip can be used to create archives
  that use the specified encoding in the majority of cases but UTF-8 and
  the language encoding flag for filenames that cannot be encoded
  using the specified encoding.</p>

<p>The unzip-task will recognize the unicode extra fields by default
  and read the file name information from them, unless you set the
  optional attribute <code>scanForUnicodeExtraFields</code> to
  false.</p>

<h4>Recommendations for Interoperability</h4>

<p>The optimal setting of flags depends on the archivers you expect as
  consumers/producers of the ZIP archives.  Below are some test
  results which may be superseeded with later versions of each
  tool.</p>

<ul>
  <li>The java.util.zip package used by the jar executable or to read
    jars from your CLASSPATH reads and writes UTF-8 names, it doesn't
    set or recognize any flags or unicode extra fields.</li>

  <li>Starting with Java7 <code>java.util.zip</code> writes UTF-8 by
    default and uses the language encoding flag.  It is possible to
    specify a different encoding when reading/writing ZIPs via new
    constructors.  The package now recognizes the language encoding
    flag when reading and ignores the Unicode extra fields.</li>

  <li>7Zip writes CodePage 437 by default but uses UTF-8 and the
    language encoding flag when writing entries that cannot be encoded
    as CodePage 437 (similar to the zip task with fallbacktoUTF8 set
    to true).  It recognizes the language encoding flag when reading
    and ignores the unicode extra fields.</li>

  <li>WinZIP writes CodePage 437 and uses unicode extra fields by
    default.  It recognizes the unicode extra field and the language
    encoding flag when reading.</li>

  <li>Windows' "compressed folder" feature doesn't recognize any flag
    or extra field and creates archives using the platforms default
    encoding - and expects archives to be in that encoding when reading
    them.</li>

  <li>InfoZIP based tools can recognize and write both, it is a
    compile time option and depends on the platform so your mileage
    may vary.</li>

  <li>PKWARE zip tools recognize both and prefer the language encoding
    flag.  They create archives using CodePage 437 if possible and UTF-8
    plus the language encoding flag for file names that cannot be
    encoded as CodePage 437.</li>
</ul>

<p>So, what to do?</p>

<p>If you are creating jars, then java.util.zip is your main
  consumer.  We recommend you set the encoding to UTF-8 and keep the
  language encoding flag enabled.  The flag won't help or hurt
  java.util.zip prior to Java7 but archivers that support it will show
  the correct file names.</p>

<p>For maximum interop it is probably best to set the encoding to
  UTF-8, enable the language encoding flag and create unicode extra
  fields when writing ZIPs.  Such archives should be extracted
  correctly by java.util.zip, 7Zip, WinZIP, PKWARE tools and most
  likely InfoZIP tools.  They will be unusable with Windows'
  "compressed folders" feature and bigger than archives without the
  unicode extra fields, though.</p>

<p>If Windows' "compressed folders" is your primary consumer, then
  your best option is to explicitly set the encoding to the target
  platform.  You may want to enable creation of unicode extra fields
  so the tools that support them will extract the file names
  correctly.</p>

<h3>Parameters specified as nested elements</h3>

<h4>any resource collection</h4>
<p><a href="../Types/resources.html#collection">Resource
Collection</a>s are used to select groups of files to archive.</p>
<p>Prior to Ant 1.7 only <code>&lt;fileset&gt;</code> and
<code>&lt;zipfileset&gt;</code> have been supported as nested elements.</p>

<a name="zipgroupfileset" />
<h4>zipgroupfileset</h4>
<p>A <code>&lt;zipgroupfileset&gt;</code> allows for multiple zip files to be 
merged into the archive. Each file found in this fileset is added to the archive 
the same way that <i>zipfileset src</i> files are added.</p>

<p><code>&lt;zipgroupfileset&gt;</code> is
  a <a href="../Types/fileset.html">fileset</a> and supports all
  of its attributes and nested elements.</a>

<h3>Examples</h3>
<pre>  &lt;zip destfile=&quot;${dist}/manual.zip&quot;
       basedir=&quot;htdocs/manual&quot;
  /&gt;</pre>
<p>zips all files in the <code>htdocs/manual</code> directory into a file called <code>manual.zip</code>
in the <code>${dist}</code> directory.</p>
<pre>  &lt;zip destfile=&quot;${dist}/manual.zip&quot;
       basedir=&quot;htdocs/manual&quot;
       update=&quot;true&quot;
  /&gt;</pre>
<p>zips all files in the <code>htdocs/manual</code> directory into a file called <code>manual.zip</code>
in the <code>${dist}</code> directory. If <code>manual.zip</code>
doesn't exist, it is created; otherwise it is updated with the
new/changed files.</p>
<pre>  &lt;zip destfile=&quot;${dist}/manual.zip&quot;
       basedir=&quot;htdocs/manual&quot;
       excludes=&quot;mydocs/**, **/todo.html&quot;
  /&gt;</pre>
<p>zips all files in the <code>htdocs/manual</code> directory. Files in the directory <code>mydocs</code>,
or files with the name <code>todo.html</code> are excluded.</p>
<pre>  &lt;zip destfile=&quot;${dist}/manual.zip&quot;
       basedir=&quot;htdocs/manual&quot;
       includes=&quot;api/**/*.html&quot;
       excludes=&quot;**/todo.html&quot;
  /&gt;</pre>
<p>zips all files in the <code>htdocs/manual</code> directory. Only html files under the directory <code>api</code>
are zipped, and files with the name <code>todo.html</code> are excluded.</p>
<pre>  &lt;zip destfile=&quot;${dist}/manual.zip&quot;&gt;
    &lt;fileset dir=&quot;htdocs/manual&quot;/&gt;
    &lt;fileset dir=&quot;.&quot; includes=&quot;ChangeLog.txt&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;/zip&gt;</pre>
<p>zips all files in the <code>htdocs/manual</code> directory, and also adds the file <code>ChangeLog.txt</code> in the
current directory. <code>ChangeLog.txt</code> will be added to the top of the ZIP file, just as if
it had been located at <code>htdocs/manual/ChangeLog.txt</code>.</p>
<pre>  &lt;zip destfile=&quot;${dist}/manual.zip&quot;&gt;
    &lt;zipfileset dir=&quot;htdocs/manual&quot; prefix=&quot;docs/user-guide&quot;/&gt;
    &lt;zipfileset dir=&quot;.&quot; includes=&quot;ChangeLog27.txt&quot; fullpath=&quot;docs/ChangeLog.txt&quot;/&gt;
    &lt;zipfileset src=&quot;examples.zip&quot; includes=&quot;**/*.html&quot; prefix=&quot;docs/examples&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;/zip&gt;</pre>
<p>zips all files in the <code>htdocs/manual</code> directory into the <code>docs/user-guide</code> directory
in the archive, adds the file <code>ChangeLog27.txt</code> in the
current directory as <code>docs/ChangeLog.txt</code>, and includes all the html files in <code>examples.zip</code> 
under <code>docs/examples</code>.  The archive might end up containing the files:</p>
<pre>    docs/user-guide/html/index.html
    docs/ChangeLog.txt
    docs/examples/index.html
</pre>
<p>
The code
<pre>
  &lt;zip destfile=&quot;${dist}/manual.zip&quot;&gt;
    &lt;zipfileset dir=&quot;htdocs/manual&quot; prefix=&quot;docs/user-guide&quot;/&gt;
    &lt;zipgroupfileset dir=&quot;.&quot; includes=&quot;examples*.zip&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;/zip&gt;
</pre>
<p>
<p>zips all files in the <code>htdocs/manual</code> directory into the <code>docs/user-guide</code> directory in the archive and includes all the files in any file that maches <code>examples*.zip</code>, such as all files within <code>examples1.zip</code> or <code>examples_for_brian.zip</code>.
The same can be achieved with
<pre>
  &lt;zip destfile=&quot;${dist}/manual.zip&quot;&gt;
    &lt;mappedresources&gt;
      &lt;fileset dir=&quot;htdocs/manual&quot;/&gt;
      &lt;globmapper from="*" to="docs/user-guide/*"/&gt;
    &lt;/mappedresources&gt;
    &lt;archives&gt;
      &lt;zips&gt;
        &lt;fileset dir=&quot;.&quot; includes=&quot;examples*.zip&quot;/&gt;
      &lt;/zips&gt;
    &lt;/archives&gt;
  &lt;/zip&gt;
</pre>

The next example

<pre>
&lt;zip dest="release.zip"&gt;
  &lt;tarfileset src="release.tar"/&gt;
&lt;/zip&gt;
</pre>

<p>re-packages a TAR archive as a ZIP archive.  If Unix file
permissions have been stored as part of the TAR file, they will be
retained in the resulting ZIP archive.</p>
