    <h2>Programming your own Selectors</h2>

    <h3>Selector Programming API</h3>

    <p>Want to define your own selectors? It's easy!</p>

    <p>First, pick the type of selector that you want to define. There
    are three types, and a recipe for each one follows. Chances are
    you'll want to work with the first one, Custom Selectors.</p>

    <ol>
      <li>Custom Selectors

        <p>This is the category that Apache Ant provides specifically for you to
        define your own Selectors. Anywhere you want to use your selector
        you use the <code>&lt;custom&gt;</code> element and specify
        the class name of your selector within it. See the
        <a href="selectors.html#customselect">Custom Selectors</a>
        section of the Selector page for details. The
        <code>&lt;custom&gt;</code> element can be used anywhere
        the core selectors can be used. It can be contained within
        <a href="selectors.html#selectcontainers">Selector Containers</a>,
        for example.</p>

        <p>To create a new Custom Selector, you have to create a class that
        implements
        <code>org.apache.tools.ant.types.selectors.ExtendFileSelector</code>.
        The easiest way to do that is through the convenience base class
        <code>org.apache.tools.ant.types.selectors.BaseExtendSelector</code>,
        which provides all of the methods for supporting
        <code>&lt;param&gt;</code> tags. First, override the
        <code>isSelected()</code> method, and optionally the
        <code>verifySettings()</code> method. If your custom
        selector requires parameters to be set, you can also override
        the <code>setParameters()</code> method and interpret the
        parameters that are passed in any way you like. Several of the
        core selectors demonstrate how to do that because they can
        also be used as custom selectors.</p>

      <li>Core Selectors

        <p>These are the selectors used by Ant itself. To implement one of
        these, you will have to alter some of the classes contained within
        Ant.</p>

        <ul>
          <li><p>First, create a class that implements
            <code>org.apache.tools.ant.types.selectors.FileSelector</code>.
            You can either choose to implement all methods yourself from
            scratch, or you can extend
            <code>org.apache.tools.ant.types.selectors.BaseSelector</code>
            instead, a convenience class that provides reasonable default
            behaviour for many methods.</p>

            <p>There is only one method required.
            <code>public boolean isSelected(File basedir, String filename,
              File file)</code>
              is the real purpose of the whole exercise. It returns true
              or false depending on whether the given file should be
              selected from the list or not.</p>

            <p>If you are using
            <code>org.apache.tools.ant.types.selectors.BaseSelector</code>
            there are also some predefined behaviours you can take advantage
            of. Any time you encounter a problem when setting attributes or
            adding tags, you can call setError(String errmsg) and the class
            will know that there is a problem. Then, at the top of your
            <code>isSelected()</code> method call <code>validate()</code> and
            a BuildException will be thrown with the contents of your error
            message. The <code>validate()</code> method also gives you a
            last chance to check your settings for consistency because it
            calls <code>verifySettings()</code>. Override this method and
            call <code>setError()</code> within it if you detect any
            problems in how your selector is set up.</p>

            <p>You may also want to override <code>toString()</code>.</p>

          <li><p>Put an <code>add</code> method for your selector in
            <code>org.apache.tools.ant.types.selectors.SelectorContainer</code>.
            This is an interface, so you will also have to add an implementation
            for the method in the classes which implement it, namely
            <code>org.apache.tools.ant.types.AbstractFileSet</code>,
            <code>org.apache.tools.ant.taskdefs.MatchingTask</code> and
            <code>org.apache.tools.ant.types.selectors.BaseSelectorContainer</code>.
            Once it is in there, it will be available everywhere that core
            selectors are appropriate.</p>
        </ul>

      <li>Selector Containers
        <p>Got an idea for a new Selector Container? Creating a new one is
        no problem:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><p>Create a new class that implements
            <code>org.apache.tools.ant.types.selectors.SelectorContainer</code>.
            This will ensure that your new
            Container can access any new selectors that come along. Again, there
            is a convenience class available for you called
            <code>org.apache.tools.ant.types.selectors.BaseSelectorContainer</code>.
            </p>
          <li><p>Implement the
            <code>public boolean isSelected(String filename, File file)</code>
            method to do the right thing. Chances are you'll want to iterate
            over the selectors under you, so use
            <code>selectorElements()</code> to get an iterator that will do
            that.</p>
          <li><p>Again, put an <code>add</code> method for your container in
            <code>org.apache.tools.ant.types.selectors.SelectorContainer</code>
            and its implementations
            <code>org.apache.tools.ant.types.AbstractFileSet</code> and
            <code>org.apache.tools.ant.types.selectors.BaseSelectorContainer</code>.
            </p>
        </ul>
    </ol>

    <h3>Testing Selectors</h3>

    <p>For a robust component (and selectors are (Project)Components) tests are
    necessary. For testing Tasks we use JUnit TestCases - more specific
    <tt>org.apache.tools.ant.BuildFileTest extends junit.framework.TestCase</tt>.
    Some of its features like configure the (test) project by reading its buildfile and
    execute targets we need for selector tests also. Therefore we use that BuildFileTest.
    But testing selectors requires some more work: having a set of files, instantiate
    and configure the selector, check the selection work and more. Because we usually
    extend <tt>BaseExtendSelector</tt> its features have to be tested also (e.g. setError()).
    </p>

    <p>That's why we have a base class for doing our selector tests:
    <tt>org.apache.tools.ant.types.selectors.BaseSelectorTest</tt>.</p>

    <p>This class extends TestCase and therefore can included in the set of Ant's
    unit tests. It holds an instance of preconfigured BuildFileTest. Configuration
    is done by parsing the src/etc/testcases/types/selectors.xml. BaseSelectorTest
    then gives us helper methods for handling multiple selections. </p>

    <p>Because the term "testcase" or "testenvironment" are so often used, this
    special testenvironment got a new name: <i>bed</i>. Like you initialize the
    test environment by calling setUp() and cleaning by calling tearDown() (<i>or like
    to make your bed before go sleeping</i>) you have to do that work with your
    <i>bed</i> by calling <tt>makeBed()</tt> respecitive <tt>cleanupBed()</tt>.</p>

    <p>A usual test scenario is<ol>
       <li>make the bed</li>
       <li>instantiate the selector</li>
       <li>configure the selector</li>
       <li>let the selector do some work</li>
       <li>verify the work</li>
       <li>clean the bed</li>
       </ol>
    </p>

    <p>For common way of instantiation you have to override the <tt>getInstance()</tt>
    simply by returning a new object of your selector. For easier "selection and verification work"
    BaseSelectorTest provides the method <tt>performTests()</tt> which
    iterates over all files (and directories) in the String array <tt>filenames</tt>
    and checks whether the given selector returns the expected result. If an error
    occurred (especially the selector does not return the expected result) the test
    fails and the failing filenames are logged.</p>

    <p>An example test would be:<pre>
package org.apache.tools.ant.types.selectors;

public class MySelectorTest extends BaseSelectorTest {

    public MySelectorTest(String name) {
        super(name);
    }

    public BaseSelector getInstance() {
        return new MySelector();
    }

    public void testCase1() {
        try {
            // initialize test environment 'bed'
            makeBed();

            // Configure the selector
            MySelector s = (MySelector)getSelector();
            s.addParam("key1", "value1");
            s.addParam("key2", "value2");
            s.setXX(true);
            s.setYY("a value");

            // do the tests
            performTests(s, "FTTTTTTTTTTT");  // First is not selected - rest is

        } finally {
            // cleanup the environment
            cleanupBed();
        }
    }
}
    </pre>
    As an example of an error JUnit could log<pre>
    [junit]     FAILED
    [junit] Error for files: <font color=blue>.;copy.filterset.filtered;tar/gz/asf-logo.gif.tar.gz</font>
    [junit] expected:&lt;<font color=blue>FTTTFTTTF...</font>&gt; but was:&lt;TTTTTTTTT...&gt;
    [junit] junit.framework.ComparisonFailure: Error for files: .;copy.filterset.filtered;tar/gz/asf-logo.gif.tar.gz
    [junit] expected:&lt;FTTTFTTTF...&gt; but was:&lt;TTTTTTTTT...&gt;
    [junit]     at junit.framework.Assert.assertEquals(Assert.java:81)
    [junit]     at org.apache.tools.ant.types.selectors.BaseSelectorTest.performTest(BaseSelectorTest.java:194)
    </pre></p>

    <p>Described above the test class should provide a <tt>getInstance()</tt>
    method. But that isn't used here. The used <tt>getSelector()</tt> method is
    implemented in the base class and gives an instance of an Ant Project to
    the selector. This is usually done inside normal build file runs, but not
    inside this special environment, so this method gives the selector the
    ability to use its own Project object (<tt>getProject()</tt>), for example
    for logging.</p>


    <h3>Logging</h3>

    <p>During development and maybe later you sometimes need the output of information.
    Therefore Logging is needed. Because the selector extends BaseExtendSelector or directly
    BaseSelector it is an Ant <tt>DataType</tt> and therefore a <tt>ProjectComponent</tt>. <br>
    That means that you have access to the project object and its logging capability.
    <tt>ProjectComponent</tt> itself provides <i>log</i> methods which will do the
    access to the project instance. Logging is therefore done simply with:
    <pre>
        log( "message" );
    </pre>
    or
    <pre>
        log( "message" , loglevel );
    </pre>
    where the <tt>loglevel</tt> is one of the values <ul>
    <li> org.apache.tools.ant.Project.MSG_ERR </li>
    <li> org.apache.tools.ant.Project.MSG_WARN </li>
    <li> org.apache.tools.ant.Project.MSG_INFO  (= default) </li>
    <li> org.apache.tools.ant.Project.MSG_VERBOSE </li>
    <li> org.apache.tools.ant.Project.MSG_DEBUG </li>
    </ul>
    </p>
