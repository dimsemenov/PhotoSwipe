<p>
The StarTeam revision control system was recently acquired by Borland.
These tasks make use of functions from the StarTeam API to work with that system.  
As a result they are only available to licensed users of StarTeam.  You must have
<CODE>starteam-sdk.jar</CODE> in your classpath to run these tasks.
For more information about the StarTeam API and how to license it, see
the <a href="http://www.borland.com/starteam/">Borland</a> web site.</p>
  <p>
    <em>All the StarTeam task names are in lower case.</em>
  </p>
<h3>Important Note on Installation and Licensing:</h3>
<p>
<b>On Windows machines, the mere presence of <CODE>starteam-sdk.jar</CODE> on the classpath 
is not sufficient for getting these tasks to work properly.</b>  These tasks also require a 
fully-installed and fully-licensed version of the StarGate Runtime.  This is part 
of a StarTeam client installation or may be installed separately.  The full client
install is not required.  In particular, the Windows path must include the directory where 
the StarGate Runtime <CODE>.dll</CODE> files are installed.
</p><p>
Earlier versions of Apache Ant (prior to 1.5.2) did not have this restriction because they
were not as dependent on the StarTeam runtime - which the newer versions use to access
StarTeam file status information.  The older versions lacked this important capability.

<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre>
  &lt;stcheckout servername="STARTEAM" 
              serverport="49201"
              projectname="AProject" 
              viewname="AView"
              username="auser"
              password="secret"
              rootlocalfolder="C:\dev\buildtest\co"
              forced="true"
  /&gt;
</pre>

The minimum necessary to check out files out from a StarTeam server.  This will
check out all files in the <i>AView</i> view of the <i>AProject</i> project to
<code>C:\dev\buildtest\co</code>.  Empty folders in StarTeam will have local folders 
created for them and any non-StarTeam files found in the tree will be deleted.

<pre>
  &lt;stcheckout URL="STARTEAM:49201/Aproject/AView" 
              username="auser"
              password="secret"
              rootlocalfolder="C:\dev\buildtest\co"
              forced="true"
  /&gt;
</pre>
And this is a simpler way of accomplishing the same thing as the previous example, using the URL attribute.
<br></br>
<pre>
  &lt;stcheckout URL="STARTEAM:49201/Aproject/AView" 
              username="auser"
              password="secret"
              rootlocalfolder="C:\dev\buildtest\co"
              rootstarteamfolder="\Dev"
              excludes="*.bak *.old"
              label="v2.6.001"
              forced="true"
  /&gt;
</pre>

This will check out all files from the <i>Dev</i> folder and below that do not
end in <i>.bak</i> or <i>.old</i> with the label <i>v2.6.001</i>.  

<pre>
  &lt;stcheckout URL="STARTEAM:49201/Aproject/AView"
              username="auser"
              password="secret"
              rootlocalfolder="C:\dev\buildtest\co"
              includes="*.htm,*.html"
              excludes="index.*"
              forced="true"
  /&gt;
</pre>

     
This is an example of overlapping <i>includes</i> and <i>excludes</i> attributes.  Because
<i>excludes</i> takes precedence over <i>includes</i>, files named <code>index.html</code> will
not be checked out by this command.

<pre>
  &lt;stcheckout URL="STARTEAM:49201/Aproject/AView"
              username="auser"
              password="secret"
              rootlocalfolder="C:\dev\buildtest\co"
              includes="*.htm,*.html"
              excludes="index.*"
              forced="true"
              recursive="false"
  /&gt;
</pre>
This example is like the previous one, but will only check out files in 
C:\dev\buildtest\co, because of the turning off of the recursive attribute.

<pre>
  &lt;stcheckout URL="STARTEAM:49201/Aproject/AView"
              username="auser"
              password="secret"
              rootstarteamfolder="src/java"
              rootlocalfolder="C:\dev\buildtest\co"
              forced="true"
  /&gt;
</pre>
<br></br>
<pre>
  &lt;stcheckout URL="STARTEAM:49201/Aproject/AView"
              username="auser"
              password="secret"
              rootstarteamfolder="src/java"
  /&gt;
</pre>
<br></br>
<pre>
 &lt;stcheckout URL="STARTEAM:49201/Aproject/AView"
             username="auser"
             password="secret"
             rootstarteamfolder="src/java"
             rootlocalfolder="C:\dev\buildtest\co\src\java"
             forced="true"
  /&gt;
</pre>

In the preceding three examples, assuming that the AProject project has a default folder of
"C:\work\AProject", the first example will check out the tree of files rooted in the src/java folder of the AView view of the AProject in the StarTeam repository to a local tree rooted at C:\dev\buildtest\co, 
the second to a tree rooted at C:\work\AProject\src\java (since no <i>rootlocalfolder</i> is specified) and the third to a tree rooted at C:\dev\buildtest\co\src\java.  Note also, that since the second example does not set "forced" true, only those files which the repository considers out-of-date will be checked out.

             forced="true"
  /&gt;
</pre>

The minimum necessary to check files into a StarTeam server.  This will
check all files on the local tree rooted at <code>C:\dev\buildtest\co</code>
into the <i>AView</i> view of the <i>AProject</i> project in the repository.
For files and folders in the local tree but not in starteam, nothing will be done.  Since the <i>forced</i> attribute is set, the files which are checked in will be checked in without regard to what the StarTeam repository considers their status to be.  This is a reasonable choice of attributes since StarTeam's status for a file is calculated based on the local file in the StarTeam default directory, not on the directory we are actually working with.

This will check all files in to the <i>Dev</i> folder and below that do not

This example is like the previous one, but will only check in files from

  /&gt;
</pre>
This example is like the previous one, but will only check only in one file, C:\dev\buildtest\co\version.java to the StarTeam folder src/java.  Because the <i>addUncontrolled</i> attribute has been set, if StarTeam does not already control this file in this location, it will be added to the repository.  Also, it will write a comment to the repository for this version of the file.

In the preceding three examples, assuming that the AProject project has a default folder of C:\work\buildtest\co\AProject,  
the first example will check in files from a tree rooted at C:\dev\buildtest\co, 
the second from a tree rooted at C:\work\buildtest\co\AProject\src\java, 
and the third from a tree rooted at C:\dev\buildtest\co\src\java all to a tree rooted at src/java

<h3>Examples</h3>

This example shows the use of this tag.  It will create a View label that is a build label named <i>Version 6.2</i> with
<i>&quot;Thorough description&quot;</i> as its description.
<pre>

This example creates a non-build View label named <i>Version 6.3</i> with
<i>&quot;Thorough description&quot;</i> as its description.
<pre>
  &lt;tstamp&gt;
    &lt;format property="nowstamp" pattern="yyyyMMddHHmmss" locale="en"/&gt;

<a name="starteam">
<h2>Starteam</h2></a>
<h3><i>Deprecated</i></h3>
<p><i>This task has been deprecated.  Use the <a href="#stcheckout">STCheckout</a> task instead.</i></p>
<h3>Description</h3>

Checks out files from a StarTeam project.

The <i>includes</i> and <i>excludes</i> attributes function differently from
other tasks in Ant.  Multiple patterns must be separated by spaces, not
commas.  See the examples for more information.</p>

<h3>Examples</h3>

            password="secret"
            targetfolder="C:\dev\buildtest\co"
  /&gt;
</pre>

The minimum necessary to check out files out from a StarTeam server.  This will
check out all files in the <i>AView</i> view of the <i>AProject</i> project to
<code>C:\dev\buildtest\co</code>.

<pre>
  &lt;starteam servername="STARTEAM" 
            serverport="49201"
            projectname="AProject"

            foldername="\Dev"
            excludes="*.bak *.old"
            force="true"
  /&gt;
</pre>

This will checkout all files from the <i>Dev</i> folder and below that do not
end in <i>.bak</i> or <i>.old</i>.  The force flag will cause any existing files to be
overwritten by the version in StarTeam.

<pre>
  &lt;starteam servername="STARTEAM"

            includes="*.htm *.html"
            excludes="index.*"
  /&gt;
</pre>


       
This is an example of overlapping <i>includes</i> and <i>excludes</i> attributes.  Because
<i>excludes</i> takes precedence over <i>includes</i>, files named <code>index.html</code> will
not be checked out by this command.

            targetfolder="C:\dev\buildtest\co\src\java"
            targetfolderabsolute="true"
  /&gt;
</pre>

In the preceding three examples, assuming that the AProject project has a default folder of
"AProject", the first example will check the files located in starteam under src/java out to a tree rooted at C:\dev\buildtest\co, 
the second to a tree rooted at C:\dev\buildtest\co\AProject\src\java and the third to a tree rooted at C:\dev\buildtest\co\src\java.
