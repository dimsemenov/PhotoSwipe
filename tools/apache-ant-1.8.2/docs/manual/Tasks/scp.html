<h2><a name="scp">SCP</a></h2>
<h3>Description</h3>

<p><em>since Apache Ant 1.6</em></p>

<p>Copies a file or FileSet to or from a (remote) machine running an SSH daemon.
FileSet <i>only</i> works for copying files from the local machine to a
remote machine.</p>

<p><b>Note:</b> This task depends on external libraries not included
in the Ant distribution.  See <a
href="../install.html#librarydependencies">Library Dependencies</a>
for more information.  This task has been tested with jsch-0.1.2 and later.</p>

<h3>Parameters specified as nested elements</h3>

<h4>fileset</h4>
 <p><a href="../Types/fileset.html">FileSet</a>s are used to select
sets of files to copy.
 To use a fileset, the <code>todir</code> attribute must be set.</p>

<h3>Examples</h3>
<p><b>Copy a single local file to a remote machine</b></p>
<pre>
  &lt;scp file=&quot;myfile.txt&quot; todir=&quot;user:password@somehost:/home/chuck&quot;/&gt;
</pre>

<p><b>Copy a single local file to a remote machine with separate
password attribute</b></p>
<pre>
  &lt;scp file=&quot;myfile.txt&quot; todir=&quot;user@somehost:/home/chuck&quot; password=&quot;password&quot;/&gt;
</pre>

<p><b>Copy a single local file to a remote machine using key base
authentication.</b></p>
<pre>
  &lt;scp file=&quot;myfile.txt&quot;
       todir=&quot;user@somehost:/home/chuck&quot; 
       keyfile=&quot;${user.home}/.ssh/id_dsa&quot;
       passphrase=&quot;my extremely secret passphrase&quot;
  /&gt;
</pre>

<p><b>Copy a single remote file to a local directory</b></p>
<pre>
  &lt;scp file=&quot;user:password@somehost:/home/chuck/myfile.txt&quot; todir=&quot;../some/other/dir&quot;/&gt;
</pre>

<p><b>Copy a remote directory to a local directory</b></p>
<pre>
  &lt;scp file=&quot;user:password@somehost:/home/chuck/*&quot; todir=&quot;/home/sara&quot;/&gt;
</pre>

<p><b>Copy a local directory to a remote directory</b></p>
<pre>
  &lt;scp todir=&quot;user:password@somehost:/home/chuck/&quot;&gt;
    &lt;fileset dir=&quot;src_dir&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;/scp&gt;
</pre>
<p><b>Copy a set of files to a directory</b></p>
<pre>
  &lt;scp todir=&quot;user:password@somehost:/home/chuck&quot;&gt;
    &lt;fileset dir=&quot;src_dir&quot;&gt;
      &lt;include name=&quot;**/*.java&quot;/&gt;
    &lt;/fileset&gt;
  &lt;/scp&gt;

  &lt;scp todir=&quot;user:password@somehost:/home/chuck&quot;&gt;
    &lt;fileset dir=&quot;src_dir&quot; excludes=&quot;**/*.java&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;/scp&gt;
</pre>

<p><strong>Security Note:</strong>  Hard coding passwords and/or usernames
in scp task can be a serious security hole.  Consider using variable
substitution and include the password on the command line.  For example:
<p>
<pre>
    &lt;scp todir=&quot;${username}:${password}@host:/dir&quot; ...&gt;
</pre>
Invoking ant with the following command line:
<pre>
    ant -Dusername=me -Dpassword=mypassword target1 target2
</pre>

Is slightly better, but the username/password is exposed to all users on an Unix
system (via the ps command). The best approach is to use the
<code>&lt;input&gt;</code> task and/or retrieve the password from a (secured)
.properties file.

<p>

<p><strong>Unix Note:</strong> File permissions are not retained when files
are copied; they end up with the default <code>UMASK</code> permissions
instead. This is caused by the lack of any means to query or set file
permissions in the current Java runtimes. If you need a permission-
preserving copy function, use <code>&lt;exec executable="scp" ... &gt;</code>
instead.
