  <title>Import Task</title>
</head>
<body>
  <h2><a name="import">Import</a></h2>
  <h3>Description</h3>
  <p>
    Imports another build file into the current project.
  </p>

  <p>
    On execution it will select the proper ProjectHelper to parse the imported
    file, using the same algorithm as the one executed at
    <a href="../projecthelper.html">startup</a>. The selected ProjectHelper
    instance will then be responsible to actually parse the imported file.
  </p>

  <p>
    <b>Note</b> as seen above, this task heavily relies on the ProjectHelper
    implementation and doesn't really perform any work of its own.  If
    you have configured Apache Ant to use a ProjectHelper other than Ant's
    default, this task may or may not work.
  </p>

  <p>
    In the common use case where only Ant's default project helper is
    used, it basically works like the 
    <a href="http://ant.apache.org/faq.html#xml-entity-include">Entity
      Includes as explained in the Ant FAQ</a>, as if the imported file was
    contained in the importing file, minus the top <code>&lt;project&gt;</code>
    tag.
  </p>

  <p>
    The import task may only be used as a top-level task. This means that
    it may not be used in a target.
  </p>
  <p>
There are two further functional aspects that pertain to this task and
that are not possible with entity includes:
<ul>
  <li>target overriding</li>
  <li>special properties</li>
</ul>
  </p>
<h4>Target overriding</h4>

<p>If a target in the main file is also present in at least one of the
imported files, the one from the main file takes precedence.</p>

<p>So if I import for example a <i>docsbuild.xml</i> file named <b>builddocs</b>,
that contains a &quot;<b>docs</b>&quot; target, I can redefine it in my main
buildfile and that is the one that will be called. This makes it easy to
keep the same target name, so that the overriding target is still called
by any other targets--in either the main or imported buildfile(s)--for which
it is a dependency, with a different implementation. The target from <i>docsbuild.xml</i> is
made available by the name &quot;<b>builddocs</b><b>.docs</b>&quot;.
This enables the new implementation to call the old target, thus
<i>enhancing</i> it with tasks called before or after it.</p>

<p>If you use the <i>as</i> attribute of the task, its value will be
  used to prefix the overriden target's name instead of the name
  attribute of the project tag.</p>

<h4>Special Properties</h4>

<p>Imported files are treated as they are present in the main
buildfile. This makes it easy to understand, but it makes it impossible
for them to reference files and resources relative to their path.
Because of this, for every imported file, Ant adds a property that
contains the path to the imported buildfile. With this path, the
imported buildfile can keep resources and be able to reference them
relative to its position.</p>

<p>So if I import for example a <i>docsbuild.xml</i> file named <b>builddocs</b>,
I can get its path as <b>ant.file.builddocs</b>, similarly to the <b>ant.file</b>
property of the main buildfile.</p>

<p>Note that &quot;builddocs&quot; is not the filename, but the name attribute
present in the imported project tag.</p>
  <p>
    If the imported file does not have a name attribute, the ant.file.projectname
    property will not be set.
  </p>

<p>Since Ant 1.8.0 the task can also import resources from URLs or
  classpath resources (which are URLs, really).  If you need to know
  whether the current build file's source has been a file or an URL
  you can consult the
  property <b>ant.file.type.<em>projectname</em></b> (using the same
  example as above <b>ant.file.type.builddocs</b>) which either have
  the value "file" or "url".</p>

<h4>Resolving files against the imported file</h4>

<p>Suppose your main build file called <code>importing.xml</code>
imports a build file <code>imported.xml</code>, located anywhere on
the file system, and <code>imported.xml</code> reads a set of
properties from <code>imported.properties</code>:</p>

<pre>&lt;!-- importing.xml --&gt;
&lt;project name="importing" basedir="." default="..."&gt;
&nbsp; &lt;import file="${path_to_imported}/imported.xml"/&gt;
&lt;/project&gt;

&lt;!-- imported.xml --&gt;
&lt;project name="imported" basedir="." default="..."&gt;
&nbsp; &lt;property file="imported.properties"/&gt;
&lt;/project&gt;
</pre>

<p>This snippet however will resolve <code>imported.properties</code>
against the basedir of <code>importing.xml</code>, because the basedir
of <code>imported.xml</code> is ignored by Ant. The right way to use
<code>imported.properties</code> is:</p>

<pre>
&lt;!-- imported.xml --&gt;
&lt;project name="imported" basedir="." default="..."&gt;
&nbsp; &lt;dirname property="imported.basedir" file="${ant.file.imported}"/&gt;
&nbsp; &lt;property file="${imported.basedir}/imported.properties"/&gt;
&lt;/project&gt;
</pre>

<p>As explained above <code>${ant.file.imported}</code> stores the
path of the build script, that defines the project called
<code>imported</code>, (in short it stores the path to
<code>imported.xml</code>) and <a
href="dirname.html"><code>&lt;dirname&gt;</code></a> takes its
directory. This technique also allows <code>imported.xml</code> to be
used as a standalone file (without being imported in other
project).</p>

<p>The above description only works for imported files that actually
  are imported from files and not from URLs.  For files imported from
  URLs using resources relative to the imported file requires you to
  use tasks that can work on non-file resources in the first place.
  To create a relative resource you'd use something like:</p>

<pre>
  &lt;loadproperties&gt;
    &lt;url baseUrl="${ant.file.imported}"
         relativePath="imported.properties"/&gt;
  &lt;/loadproperties&gt;
</pre>

<h3>Parameters</h3>

<h3>Parameters specified as nested elements</h3>

<h4>any <a href="../Types/resources.html">resource</a> or resource
collection</h4>

<p>The specified resources will be imported.  <em>Since Ant
    1.8.0</em></p>

<h3>Examples</h3>
<pre>&nbsp; &lt;import file=&quot;../common-targets.xml&quot;/&gt;
</pre>

<p>Imports targets from the common-targets.xml file that is in a parent
directory.</p>

<pre>&nbsp; &lt;import file=&quot;${deploy-platform}.xml&quot;/&gt;
</pre>

<p>Imports the project defined by the property deploy-platform</p>

<pre>
  &lt;import&gt;
    &lt;javaresource name="common/targets.xml"&gt;
      &lt;classpath location="common.jar"/&gt;
    &lt;/javaresource&gt;
  &lt;/import&gt;
</pre>

<p>Imports targets from the targets.xml file that is inside the
  directory common inside the jar file common.jar.</p>

<h3>How is &lt;import&gt; different
  from <a href="include.html">&lt;include&gt;</a>?</h3>

<p>The short version: Use import if you intend to override a target,
  otherwise use include.</p>

<p>When using import the imported targets are available by up to two
  names.  Their "normal" name without any prefix and potentially with
  a prefixed name (the value of the as attribute or the imported
  project's name attribute, if any).</p>

<p>When using include the included targets are only available in the
  prefixed form.</p>

<p>When using import, the imported target's depends attribute
  remains unchanged, i.e. it uses "normal" names and allows you to
  override targets in the dependency list.</p>

<p>When using include, the included targets cannot be overridden and
  their depends attributes are rewritten so that prefixed names are
  used.  This allows writers of the included file to control which
  target is invoked as part of the dependencies.</p>

<p>It is possible to include the same file more than once by using
  different prefixes, it is not possible to import the same file more
  than once.</p>

<h4>Examples</h4>

<p><i>nested.xml</i> shall be:</p>

<pre>
&lt;project&gt;
  &lt;target name="setUp"&gt;
    &lt;property name="prop" value="in nested"/&gt;
  &lt;/target&gt;

  &lt;target name="echo" depends="setUp"&gt;
    &lt;echo&gt;prop has the value ${prop}&lt;/echo&gt;
  &lt;/target&gt;
&lt;/project&gt;
</pre>

<p>When using import like in</p>

<pre>
&lt;project default="test"&gt;
  &lt;target name="setUp"&gt;
    &lt;property name="prop" value="in importing"/&gt;
  &lt;/target&gt;

  &lt;import file="nested.xml" as="nested"/&gt;

  &lt;target name="test" depends="nested.echo"/&gt;
&lt;/project&gt;
</pre>

<p>Running the build file will emit:

<pre>
setUp:

nested.echo:
     [echo] prop has the value in importing

test:

</pre>

<p>When using include like in</p>

<pre>
&lt;project default="test"&gt;
  &lt;target name="setUp"&gt;
    &lt;property name="prop" value="in importing"/&gt;
  &lt;/target&gt;

  &lt;include file="nested.xml" as="nested"/&gt;

  &lt;target name="test" depends="nested.echo"/&gt;
&lt;/project&gt;
</pre>

<p>Running the target build file will emit:

<pre>
nested.setUp:

nested.echo:
     [echo] prop has the value in nested

test:

</pre>

<p>and there won't be any target named "echo" on the including build file.</p>
